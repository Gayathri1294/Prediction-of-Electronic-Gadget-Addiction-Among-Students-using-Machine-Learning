 Electronic gadget addiction is a growing concern, particularly among students 
and young professionals, as it negatively impacts mental health, academic performance, and 
productivity. This project aims to develop a machine learning model using the Random 
Forest algorithm to predict the likelihood and severity of gadget addiction based on various 
behavioral and psychological factors. By analyzing user activity patterns, screen time, social 
media usage, sleep disturbances, and self-reported dependency levels, the Random Forest 
model effectively identifies key predictors and classifies users into different risk categories. 
Comparative analysis with traditional classification methods highlights the superior accuracy 
and robustness of the Random Forest algorithm in handling high-dimensional, nonlinear 
datasets. The system is designed to provide actionable insights to users, parents, and 
educators by offering personalized recommendations to mitigate addiction risks. By 
leveraging data-driven predictions, this approach enables early intervention strategies, 
promoting healthier digital habits and improving overall well-being.
